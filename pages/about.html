                the blog started off as a discord server, and before that was a note on my phone, but it got a little
                cluttered and hard to find things after a while. i didn't like the idea of everything being tied to an
                entity whose thoughts and motivations and tastes i didn't agree with and was not allowed access to. so, being a developer i thought it could
                be cool to have a website where i could better express my feelings on the art i love, and here we are.
